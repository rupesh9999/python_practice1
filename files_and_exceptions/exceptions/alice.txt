Okay, here's a snippet of dialogue capturing that tense moment during the Burj Khalifa climb in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (MI4), focusing on Ethan climbing and the team coordinating:

(Scene: Ethan is scaling the exterior of the Burj Khalifa. Benji is guiding him from a hotel room window, while Jane and Brandt monitor elsewhere.)

Benji: (Into comms, watching Ethan) Okay, Ethan, easy does it. You're doing great. Just remember: Blue is glue.

Ethan: (Straining, placing a glove) Got it, Benji. Blue is glue.

Benji: And...?

Ethan: (Placing the other glove) Red is dead. How much further?

Benji: Uh, let's see... carry the two... You're about thirteen floors below the server hub. Looking good. Nice and steady.

(Ethan reaches for a handhold, the blue light on his right glove flickers and goes out.)

Ethan: Benji! Glove's not sticking!

Benji: (Panicked) What? It should stick! Did you clean the surface?

Ethan: (Struggling to maintain grip with one hand) I cleaned the surface! It's not sticking!

Benji: Okay, okay! Uh... try the other one! Is the other one sticking?

Ethan: The other one's holding, but I can't climb with one glove!

Brandt: (Over comms, urgently) Ethan, Moreau's team is approaching the exchange point. Jane, status?

Jane: (Observing the target) They're in position. We don't have much time.

Benji: Okay, Ethan, listen! There's a maintenance ledge about ten feet to your left. Can you make it? You might be able to reset the glove there!

Ethan: (Looking left, calculating) It's gonna be tricky... Alright. Going for the ledge. Keep talking me through the server access protocols once I'm closer.

Benji: Copy that! Just... just get to the ledge first! Please!
